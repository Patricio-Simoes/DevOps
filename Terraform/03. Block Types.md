# 03. Block Types

Terraform configuration files are made up of different block types, which define resources, data sources, providers, modules, variables, outputs, and more.
Each block serves a specific purpose in defining infrastructure and behavior.

Bellow is a list of Terraform block types.

## Provider

Defines which provider (e.g., AWS, Azure, Google Cloud) Terraform should use, and configures credentials or region settings.

```hcl
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-east-1"
}
```

(See [Providers](02.%20Providers.md#02.%20Providers))

## Resource

Declares a piece of infrastructure that Terraform should create, update, or delete.

```hcl
resource "aws_instance" "web_server" {
  ami           = "ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
}
```

## Data

Retrieves read-only information from a provider without creating or modifying resources.

```hcl
data "aws_ami" "latest" {
  most_recent = true
  owners      = ["amazon"]

  filter {
    name   = "name"
    values = ["amzn2-ami-hvm-*-x86_64-gp2"]
  }
}
```

## Module

Groups multiple Terraform resources into a reusable component.

```hcl
module "vpc" {
  source  = "terraform-aws-modules/vpc/aws"
  version = "5.1.0"

  name = "my-vpc"
  cidr = "10.0.0.0/16"
}
```

## Variable

Defines an input value that can be passed into a Terraform configuration.

```hcl
variable "instance_type" {
  type        = string
  description = "EC2 instance type"
  default     = "t3.micro"
}
```

(See - [Variable Types](04.%20Variable%20Types.md#04.%20Variable%20Types))

## Output

Displays selected information after Terraform finishes applying the configuration.

```hcl
output "instance_public_ip" {
  value       = aws_instance.web_server.public_ip
  description = "The public IP of the web server instance"
}
```
## Locals

Defines reusable local values computed from other variables or expressions.

```hcl
locals {
  common_tags = {
    environment = "dev"
    project     = "example"
  }
}
```

## Terraform

Specifies global settings for the Terraform project — such as required providers, backend configuration, and required versions.

```hcl
terraform {
  required_version = ">= 1.6.0"

  required_providers {
    aws = {
      source  = "hashicorp/aws"
      version = "~> 5.0"
    }
  }

  backend "s3" {
    bucket = "my-tf-state"
    key    = "global/s3/terraform.tfstate"
    region = "us-east-1"
  }
}
```
