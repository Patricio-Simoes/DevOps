# 03. Providers

Terraform providers are **plugins** that enable Terraform to interact with various cloud platforms.

Each provider is responsible for understanding the API interactions and exposing the resources that can be created, managed, and updated through Terraform.

See [Version constraints](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/expressions/version-constraints).

Example:

```hcl
terraform {
	required_providers {
	    aws = {
		    source  = "hashicorp/aws"
		    version = "~> 6.0"
		}
	}
}

provider "aws" {
	region = "us-west-2"
}
```

**Note:** Providers are usually defined in the `providers.tf` file.
