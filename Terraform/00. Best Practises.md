# 00. Best Practices

Bellow is a list of best practices related to Terraform code management and workflow.

## Terraform State File

1. Do not modify the state file manually, only through Terraform commands;
2. When working with a team, always configure a shared remote storage for the state file;
3. Take advantage of state file locking when possible, (e.g AWS S3 automatically locks the state file using DynamoDB);
4. Enable state versioning in case the state file gets corrupted/manually changed;
5. Use a single state file per environment.

## Managing Terraform Code

1. Host the Terraform code in a remote repository. (e.g. BitBucket, GitLab, etc.);
2. Terraform code should be deployed through CI/CD with rigorous testing before deployment.
