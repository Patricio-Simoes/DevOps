# 02. State file

Each Terraform directory has a state file that **keeps track of what’s deployed**, so that, Terraform knows the difference between “what exists” and “what should exist”.

By default, Terraform stores the state file in the working directory, but this can be changed to something else. Like an AWS S3 Bucket with encryption applied:

```hcl
terraform {
	backend "s3" {
	    bucket = "mybucket"
		encrypt = true
	    key    = "path/to/my/key"
		region = "us-east-1"
	}
}
```
