# 02. Providers

Terraform providers are **plugins** that enable Terraform to interact with various cloud platforms.

Each provider is responsible for understanding the API interactions and exposing the resources that can be created, managed, and updated through Terraform.

**Note:** Providers are installed on the `.terraform/providers/` folder.

## Plugin versions

Provider plugins can have constraints applied to their version, a common use case is the enforcement of a specific version using the `~>` operator, which specified the latest version of a major release.

```hcl
terraform {
	required_providers {
	    aws = {
		    source  = "hashicorp/aws"
			# Pick the latest version from 6.0.0 to 7.0.0.
		    version = "~> 6.0"
		}
	}
}

provider "aws" {
	region = "us-west-2"
}
```

**Note:** See [Version constraints](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/expressions/version-constraints).
