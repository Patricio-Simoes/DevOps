# 04. Terraform workflow

A typical Terraform workflow consists of of three main steps: **Write**, **Plan**, and **Apply**. 

In this process, you write infrastructure as code, preview changes before applying them, and then provision the infrastructure based on your configurations.

## Basic workflow commands

### Initialize working directory

The **`init`** command prepares the working directory and downloads any required plugins:

```bash
terraform init
```

### Plan changes ahead of time

The **`plan`** command creates and reviews the execution plan. (No changes are applied to the infrastructure nor the state file).

```bash
terraform plan
```

### Deploy infrastructure changes

The **`apply`** command will deploy any changes present in the Terraform code. (Updates the real world infrastructure and the state file).

```bash
terraform apply
```

## Additional commands

### Validate configuration files

The **`validate`** command checks whether the configuration files are syntactically valid and internally consistent.

```bash
terraform validate
```

### Format configuration files

The **`fmt`** command formats all Terraform configuration files to a canonical format and style.

```bash
terraform fmt
```

### Show resources state

The **`show`** command displays information about Terraform resources. (Relies on the state file content).

```bash
terraform show
```
