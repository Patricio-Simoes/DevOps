# 01. State file

Each Terraform directory has a state file that **keeps track of what’s deployed**, so that, Terraform knows the difference between “what exists” and “what should exist”.

By default, Terraform stores the state file in the working directory, but this can be changed to something else.

## Remote State file

It is a good practice to keep the state file in a **remote location** with **encryption applied**.

**Note:** Stafe file configurations should be defined on the **`backend.tf`** file.

```hcl
terraform {
	backend "s3" {
	    bucket = "mybucket"
		encrypt = true
	    key    = "path/to/my/key"
		region = "us-east-1"
	}
}
```
