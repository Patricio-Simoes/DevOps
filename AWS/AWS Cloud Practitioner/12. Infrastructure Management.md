## CloudFormation

CloudFormation is a [Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)](00.%20Cloud%20Concepts.md#infrastructure-as-a-service-iass) offering that uses declarative templates (YAML/JSON) to **provision and manage AWS resources automatically** and predictably.

**Note:** Supports versioning and rollback.

## AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK)

AWS CDK is an **open-source framework to define AWS infrastructure using programming languages**. (E.g. TypeScript, Python, Java, etc.).

</div>

**Note:** Generates [CloudFormation](#cloudformation) templates behind the scenes.

## Elastic Beanstalk

Elastic Beanstalk in a [PaaS](00.%20Cloud%20Concepts.md#platform-as-a-service-paas) offering that **simplifies deployment of applications by handling the underlying infrastructure** automatically.

It integrates with [CloudWatch](11.%20Cloud%20Monitoring.md#cloudwatch) for monitoring and handles provision, scaling, patching, monitoring and healthchecks.

## Git & Code Management

### AWS CodeDeploy

CodeDeploy is a fully managed service that **automates application deployments** to [EC2](04.%20Amazon%20EC2.md#04-ec2), [Lambda](07.%20Compute%20Services.md#lambda-functions-serverless) or on-prem servers.

**Note:** For on-prem hosts or [EC2](04.%20Amazon%20EC2.md#04-ec2) instances, CodeDeploy Agent is required.

### AWS CodeCommit (Discontinued)

AWS CodeCommit was a **Git based version control service for private repositories** hosted on AWS.

</div>

**Note:** Required to servers to manage.

### AWS CodePipeline

AWS CodePipeline is a **managed CI/CD service** that automates build, test and deploy phases after every code change.

  <img src="../../Assets/Images/AWS - CodePipeline.png" alt="AWS - CodePipeline" />
</div>

**Note:** Integrates with [CodeBuild](#codebuild), [CodeDeploy](#codedeploy), [CodeCommit](#codecommit) and third-party tools, (e.g. GitHub, Jenkins, etc.).

### AWS CodeArtifact

AWS CodeArtifact is a fully managed **artifact repository for storing, publishing and sharing software packages**. (Works with `mvn`, `npm`, `yarn`, `nuget`, `pip`, etc.).

**Note:** Integrates with [CodeBuild](#codebuild) and [CodePipeline](#codepipeline).

## AWS Systems Manager (SSM)

AWS SSM is a **unified operations hub that provides visibility and control** over AWS and on-prem infrastructure.

It automates patching, inventory, session management and configuration.
