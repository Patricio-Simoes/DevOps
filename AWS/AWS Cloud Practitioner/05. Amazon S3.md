# 05. Amazon S3

Amazon S3 allows for **object, (files), storage in buckets, (directories)**, and is advertised as "infinitely scaling" storage.

**Note:** S3 buckets are **defined at a [region](02.%20AWS%20Global%20Infrastructure.md#regions) level**, it is not a global service. However, bucket names must be unique across all [regions](02.%20AWS%20Global%20Infrastructure.md#regions) and [AZs](02.%20AWS%20Global%20Infrastructure.md#Availability%20Zones%20(AZs)).

## S3 Use Cases

S3 buckets are used for:

- Backup & Storage;
- Disaster recovery;
- Archive;
- Hybrid cloud storage;
- Application hosting;
- Media hosting;
- Data lakes & Big data analytics;
- Software delivery;
- Static websites.

## S3 Objects

All S3 objects, (files), have a key which represents the their path in the bucket.

This key is composed of a prefix + the object name:

```bash
              # Key                    # Object
s3://my-bucket/my_folder/another_folder/my_file.txt
```

### S3 Object Versioning

S3 buckets are able to version objects if the versioning is toggled on. This will create a new version of the object each time it is updated.

## S3 Bucket Replication

An S3 bucket can be replicated to another S3 bucket.

For this to happen, versioning must be enabled in both the source and destination S3 Buckets.

The replication happens asynchronously and can be performed in the same or another [region](02.%20AWS%20Global%20Infrastructure.md#regions).

**Note:** This can be done between different AWS accounts.

## S3 Bucket Security

There are a few types of security enforcements that can be applied to S3 buckets:

- **User Based:**
	- [IAM Policies](03.%20IAM.md#policies) - Which API calls should be allowed for a specific IAM user.
- **Resource Based:**
	- Bucket Policies - Bucket wide rules from the S3 console. Allows cross account;
	- Object Access Control List (ACL) - Finer grain (can be disabled);
	- Bucket Access Control List (ACL) - Less common (can be disabled).
- **Encryption:**
	- Encrypts objects in S3 using encryption keys.

## S3 Storage Classes

Amazon S3 can have one of the following storage classes:

|                                  | **[Standard](#s3-standard---general-purpose)** | **[Intelligent-Tiering](#s3-intelligent-tiering)** | **[Standard IA](#standard-ia)** | **[One Zone IA](#one-zone-ia)** | **[Glacier Instant Retrieval](#instant-retrieval)** | **[Glacier Flexible Retrieval](#flexible-retrieval-former-s3-glacier)** | **[Glacier Deep Archive](#deep-archive)** |

### S3 Standard - General Purpose

- 99.9% availability;
- Used for frequently accessed data;
- Low latency & throughput;
- Can sustain 2 concurrent facility failures;
- Use cases: Big Data analytics, mobile & gaming applications, content distribution, etc.

### S3 Infrequent Access (IA)

- Used for data that is less frequently accessed but required rapid access when needed;
- Lower cost that the S3 Standard class.

#### Standard IA

- 99.9% availability;
- Use cases: Disaster recovery, backups.

#### One Zone IA

- 99.5% availability;
- Data is lost if AZ is destroyed;
- Use cases: Storing secondary backup copies of on-prem data, or data that can be re-created.

### S3 Glacier

- Low cost object storage meant for archiving/backup;
- Pricing: Price for storage + object retrieval cost.

#### Instant Retrieval

- Millisecond retrieval, great for data accessed once a quarter;
- Minimum storage duration is 90 days.

#### Flexible Retrieval (Former S3 Glacier)

- Multiple free retrieval options:
	- Expedited (1-5 minutes);
	- Standard (3-5 hours);
	- Bulk (5-12 hours).
- Minimum storage duration is 90 days.

#### Deep Archive

- Multiple free retrieval options:
	- Standard (12 hours);
	- Bulk (48 hours).
- Minimum storage duration is 180 days.

### S3 Intelligent-Tiering

- No retrieval charges;
- Small monthly monitoring and auto-tiering fee;
- Moves objects automatically between the following access tiers based on usage:
	- **Frequent Access Tier:** Default tier;
	- **Infrequent Access Tier:** Objects not accessed for 90 days;
	- **Archive Instant Access Tier:** Objects not accessed for 90 days;
	- **Archive Access Tier (optional):** Configurable from 90 days to 700+ days.
	- **Deep Archive Access Tier (optional):** Configurable from 180 days to 700+ days.

## S3 Transfer Acceleration

S3 Transfer Acceleration is a feature of Amazon S3 that **speeds up data transfers to and from** S3 buckets.

It uses the Amazon [CloudFront](02.%20AWS%20Global%20Infrastructure.md#cloudfront) global network of edge locations as a proxy.

## Amazon Athena (Analytics)

Amazon Athena is a serverless query service to perform analytics against S3 objects.

Is uses standard SQL language to query the files and supports CSV, JSON, ORC, Avro and Parquet.
