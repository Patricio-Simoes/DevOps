# 02. AWS Global Infrastructure

AWS is built on a global infrastructure designed for high availability and low latency.

## Infrastructure components

The infrastructure is built on top of the following:

</div>

### Regions

Regions are **physical locations worldwide**, each containing multiple [Availability Zones (AZs)](#Availability%20Zones%20(AZs)).

**Note:** A region is composed by **at least** three [AZs](#Availability%20Zones%20(AZs)).

**Note:** Not all AWS services are available on every region.

### Availability Zones (AZs)

AZs are isolated **data centers within a [region](#Regions)** that allow fault-tolerant architectures.

**Note:** An availability zone is composed by **at least** one data center.

### Edge Locations (Points of Presence)

Points of Presence used by [CloudFront](#CloudFront%20(CDN)) to **cache content** closer to users.

### Local Zones

Local Zones are extensions on a [region](#regions) that place AWS services physically closer to large population centers of to a specific location.

## CloudFront (CDN)

CloudFront is AWS's **Content Delivery Network** (CDN) service.

It delivers content globally with low latency by **caching copies of web content** (such as websites, videos, APIs, etc.), **at [edge locations](#edge-locations-points-of-presence)** close to users.

## Route 53 (DNS)

Route 53 is Amazon's scalable DNS web service.

### Routing Policies

Route 53 has four main routing policies:

#### Simple Routing

- Returns a single resource IP address for a DNS query;
- **Use case:** When there is only a single resource to route traffic to, with no special routing logic.

</div>

#### Weighted Routing

- Distributes traffic across multiple resources according to assigned weights (percentages);
- **Use case:** For load balancing, testing new versions or gradually shifting traffic between endpoints.

</div>

#### Latency Routing

- Routes traffic to the resource that provides the lowest latency (fastest response time) for the user's location;
- **Use case:** Improve user experience by directing them to the closest or fastest AWS region.

#### Failover Routing

- Provides active-passive failover. Traffic is routed to the primary resource unless it's unhealthy, then it fails over to a secondary resource.
- **Use case:** High availability and disaster recovery.

## AWS Global Accelerator

The AWS Global Accelerator is a networking service designed to **improve availability & performance** of applications for global users.

It leverages the AWS internal network to optimize the route to an application. (~60% improvement).
