# 00. Cloud Concepts

## Cloud Computing

Cloud computing is defined as the on-demand delivery of IT resources over the internet with a ***pay-as-you-go* pricing model**.

Instead of heavily investing in physical data centers, organizations can access computing resources as needed from a cloud provider like AWS.

There are three primary models of cloud computing:

### Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)

Provides building blocks for cloud IT, such as virtual servers and networks.
- E.g. Amazon EC2.

### Platform as a Service (PaaS)

Provides platforms for developers to build applications on, without having to manage the infrastructure.
- E.g. AWS Elastic Beanstalk.

### Software as a Service (SaaS)

Provides fully managed software applications delivered over the internet.
- E.g. Amazon Chime, Salesforce.

## Cloud Computing vs On-Prem Computing

| Aspect             | Cloud Computing                                        | On-Prem Computing                                                                 |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Hardware Ownership | Cloud Provider, (e.g. AWS, Azure, etc.).               | Organization.                                                                     |
| Resposibility      | The provider manages infrastructure maintenance.       | The organization is responsible for all hardware and software management.         |
| Scalability Costs  | Elastic scale up/down and pay accordingly.             | Fixed capacity. Scaling requires buying new hardware upfront, which is expensive. |
| Flexibility        | Wide range of services available on demand.            | Limited to installed hardware/software.                                           |
| Latency            | Depends on the internet connectivity and cloud region. | Generally lower latency as resources are local.                                   |

## High availability, Elasticity & Scalability

These are fundamental principles when working with cloud providers.

### High Availability

High Availability refers to a **system's ability to remain operational** and accessible without interruption for a minimum amount of time, even **in the event of failures**, (e.g. hardware, software or network failures).

### Elasticity

Elasticity means that, once a system is scalable, **there will be some form of auto-scaling** so that the system can scale based on it's current load.

### Scalability

Scalability refers to the **ability of a system to accommodate a larger load** by making the hardware stronger, (scaling up), or by adding nodes, (scaling out).

#### Horizontal Scaling

Horizontal scaling means **increasing the number of instances/systems** of an application.

It is possible to scale in, (decreasing the number of instances), or scale out (increasing the number of instances).

#### Vertical Scaling

Vertical scaling means **increasing the size of a single instance** to handle more load.

It is possible to **scale down**, (decreasing the size of the instance), or **scale up** (increasing the size of the instance).

## Load Balancing

Load Balancing is the **process of distributing incoming network traffic across multiple resources/servers** to ensure that no single server becomes overwhelmed and to maximize performance, reliability and availability.

### Why use a load balancer?

Some advantages of using a load balancer include:

- Spreading load across multiple downstream instances;
- Exposing a single point of access (DNS), to an application;
- Seamlessly handling failures in instances;
- Performing regular health checks to instances;
- Providing SSL termination (HTTPS) to websites;
- Ensuring high availability across zones.
