# 01. Shared Responsibility Model

The Shared Responsibility Model represents the responsibilities that the customer has while using AWS, as well as the responsibilities that AWS has while providing it's services.

## AWS Responsibility

AWS is responsible for the security **of** the cloud. This means:

- Protecting infrastructure (hardware, software, facilities and networking) that run all AWS services;

## Customer Responsibility

The customer is responsible of the security **in** the cloud. This means:

- For [EC2](04.%20Amazon%20EC2.md#04--ec2) instances, the customer is responsible for management of the guest OS, firewall, network configuration and [03. IAM](03.%20IAM.md#03--iam);
- Encrypting application data.

## Shared Responsibilities

Both AWS and the customer are responsible for:

- Patch management;
- Configuration management; 
- Awareness & Training of staff.
