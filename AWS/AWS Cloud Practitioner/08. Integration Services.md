# 08. Integration Services

## Amazon SQS

Amazon SQS is a fully managed **message queuing service** that enables **decoupled and asynchronous communication** between components in distributed or micro-services architecture.

- No message fan out - One consumer per message;
- Useful for load leveling, retry logic and background task processing.
