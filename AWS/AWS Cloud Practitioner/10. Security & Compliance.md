# 10. Security & Compliance

## DDoS Protection on AWS

AWS offers multiple layers of protection against DDoS attacks:

### AWS Shield

AWS Shield is a DDoS protection service with two tiers:

#### Shield Standard

This tier is enabled by default for all customers at **no extra cost**.

It offers protection against common **L3/L4 attacks**, (e.g. SYN/UDP floods).

#### Shield Advanced

This tier is an **optional paid service** that protects against more **sophisticated and larger-scale attacks**.

It includes 24/7 access to the DDoS Response Team (SRT) and cost protection during DDoS related usage spikes.

### AWS WAF

AWS WAF, (Web Application Firewall) is used to **protect web apps from common web exploits** (Layer 7).

It can be deployed on:

- Application Load Balancer;
- [API Gateway](08.%20Integration%20Services.md#amazon-api-gateway-serverless)
- [CloudFront](02.%20AWS%20Global%20Infrastructure.md#CloudFront%20(CDN))

###  [CloudFront](02.%20AWS%20Global%20Infrastructure.md#CloudFront%20(CDN)) & [Route 53 (DNS)](02.%20AWS%20Global%20Infrastructure.md#route-53-dns)

These services can be used to enhance DDoS mitigation and availability.

**How?**

- Combine with [AWS Shield](#aws-shield) for edge-based attack mitigation;
- Leverage global [Edge Locations (Points of Presence)](02.%20AWS%20Global%20Infrastructure.md#edge-locations-points-of-presence) for high availability and performance.

## AWS Network Firewall

AWS Network Firewall is a **managed firewall service for inspecting and filtering** [VPC](09.%20VPCs%20&%20Networking.md) traffic.

It protects for Layer 3 to Layer 7 attacks with deep packet inspection and stateless/stateful rules.

It integrates **at the VPC level**:

## AWS Firewall Manager

AWS Firewall Manager provides a **centralized management of firewall rules** across an AWS organization.

It works wit [AWS WAF](#aws-waf), [Shield Advanced](#shield-advanced) and [AWS Network Firewall](#aws-network-firewall) to help maintaining consistent security policies.

## AWS Certificate Manager (ACM)

AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) is a service to **provision, manage and deploy SSL/TLS certificates**.

AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) is free for public TLS certificates and provides automatic renewal and easy integration with AWS services.

## AWS Secrets Manager

AWS Secrets Manager securely **stores, rotates and manages secrets**.

AWS Secrets Manager is integrated with [RDS](06.%20Databases.md#amazon-rds) and supports automatic secret rotation.

**Note:** Secrets are encrypted using [KMS](#aws-key-management-service-kms).

## Data Encryption

### AWS Key Management Service (KMS)

KMS is a managed service to **create, manage and control cryptographic keys** used to encrypt data.

Key points:

- It is integrated with most AWS services, (e.g. [S3](05.%20Amazon%20S3.md), [RDS](06.%20Databases.md#amazon-rds), [EBS](04.%20Amazon%20EC2.md#ebs-volumes), etc.);
- Supports **AWS-managed keys**;
- Offers automatic key rotation;
- Keys are protected using FIPS 140-2 validated hardware;
- Can perform envelope encryption, (encrypting data keys with master keys).

### AWS CloudHSM

CloudHSM is a service that provides **dedicated** cryptographic key storage & operations.

Key points:

- Gives full control over HSMs and cryptographic keys;
- Compliant with FIPS 140-2 Level 3;
- Supports standard APIs like PKCS#11, Java JCE and Microsoft CNG;

**Note:** Compared to KMS, CloudHSM is much more complex & expensive, however, it provides more control & isolation.

## Amazon GuardDuty

Amazon GuardDuty is an **intelligent threat detection service** using ML and anomaly detection.

GuardDuty uses inputs from [CloudTrail](11.%20Cloud%20Monitoring.md#cloudtrail), [VPC Flow Logs](09.%20VPCs%20&%20Networking.md#vpc-flow-logs) and DNS logs to detect threats like cryptocurrency mining attacks.

**Note:** Optionally, it can use inputs from [EKS](07.%20Compute%20Services.md#amazon-eks-elastic-kubernetes-service), [RDS](06.%20Databases.md#amazon-rds), [Aurora](06.%20Databases.md#amazon-aurora-serverless), [EBS](04.%20Amazon%20EC2.md#ebs-volumes), [Lambda ](07.%20Compute%20Services.md#lambda-functions-serverless)and [S3](05.%20Amazon%20S3.md).

## Amazon Inspector

Amazon Inspector is an automated **vulnerability management service** for workloads

It integrates with CI/CD and security tools while scanning [EC2](04.%20Amazon%20EC2.md#04.%20EC2), [ECR](07.%20Compute%20Services.md#Amazon%20ECR%20(elastic-container-registry) and [Lambda ](07.%20Compute%20Services.md#lambda-functions-serverless) for vulnerabilities.

## Amazon Macie

Amazon Macie is a **ML powered** data security that **discovers and protects sensitive data**, (e.g. PII).

It is useful for compliance and regulatory needs, focusing on data classification and privacy.

## Security Hub

Security Hub is a **centralized security posture management** across AWS accounts.

It aggregates findings from services like [GuardDuty](#amazon-guardduty), [Inspector](#amazon-inspector) and [Macie](#amazon-macie), providing a unified dashboard for compliance and threat visibility.

## Amazon Detective

Amazon Detective is a **security investigation tool** to analyze and visualize AWS log data.

It **helps understand the context behind security findings** and works with [GuardDuty](#amazon-guardduty), [Macie](#amazon-macie) and [Security Hub](#security-hub).

## IAM Access Analyzer

IAM Access Analyzer is part of [IAM](03.%20IAM.md#03.%20IAM) and **analyzes policies to detect unintended access** to resources.

**Note:** Requires defining a zone of trust.
