# 02. Pods

A pod in Kubernetes is the **smallest and simplest unit in the Kubernetes object model** that can be created or deployed.

A **pod is ephemeral,** it can be created, destroyed and re-created regularly.

**Note:** A pod can be a host for multiple containers, however, as a best practice, only one container per pod should be allowed. If a pod has multiple containers, they will share the same network namespace and storage volumes.

## Pod Networking

Pods **share the same network namespace**, including IP address and port space.

Containers in a pod can **communicate with each other using `localhost`**.

## Creating new pods

Pods can either be created from a YAML file, or from a container image.

### YAML (Declarative)

To create pods using YAML files, first, they must be constructed using the following structure:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1 # Required field. Version of the Kubernetes API used to create the object.
kind: Pod      # Required field. Type of object to be created.
metadata:      # Required field. Data about the object.
  name: nginx-pod
  namespace: sandbox # Optional field. Default namespace if empty.
  labels:
    app: nginx
spec: # Required field. Information about the object.
  containers:
     - name: nginx-container
       image: nginx
```

> Labels allow for easy grouping and filtering of pods based on their characteristics. See [Labels & Selectors](07.%20Scheduling.md#labels-&-selectors) and [Creating a new ReplicaSet](03.%20ReplicaSets.md#creating-a-new-replicaset).


Then, using `kubectl`, run:

```bash
kubectl apply -f <file-name>
```

This will apply the configuration to the specified namespace. If there is no namespace specified, the pods will deploy to the default namespace.

### `kubectl` (Imperative)

To create new pods, using `kubectl` run:

```bash
kubectl run <pod-name> --image <container-image> -n <namespace>
```

## Pod Commands

### Checking pod(s) information

To list available pods, using `kubectl` run:

```bash
kubectl get pods -n <namespace>
# For slightly more detailed information:
kubectl get pods -n <namespace> -o wide
```

To describe a pod, using `kubectl` run:

```bash
kubectl describe pod/<pod_name> -n <namespace>
```

To check the logs of a pod, using `kubectl` run:

```bash
kubectl logs <pod_name> -n <namespace>
```

### Editing a pod after it is deployed

To edit an existing pod, using `kubectl`run:

```bash
kubectl edit pod/<pod_name> -n <namespace>
```

###  Deleting a pod

To delete a pod, using `kubectl`, run:

```bash
kubectl delete pod/<pod_name> -n <namespace>
```
