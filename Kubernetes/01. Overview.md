# 01. Overview

Kubernetes, (originally developed by Google), is an **open-source container orchestration platform** for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.

Kubernetes can be deployed on multiple platforms such as locally and on a cloud like AWS.

**Note:** For a list of Kubernetes commands, see [Kubernetes Cheatsheet](00.%20Cheatsheet.md#00--cheatsheet).
## Container Orchestration

Container Orchestration s the automatic management of containerized applications, enabling efficient application deployment, scaling, and management in a complex environment.

It brings many advantages such as:

- Because there are multiple instances of an application running in different [nodes](#nodes-minions), a hardware failure does not bring the application down. (**High availability** principle);
- The user traffic is **load balanced** across the various containers;
- The applications automatically scale up/down based on demand increase/decrease.

## Kubernetes Architecture

### Nodes (Minions)

A node, (previously known as minion), **is a machine**, (physical or virtual), on which Kubernetes is installed.

A node is a worker machine, where containers are launched by Kubernetes.

When **multiple nodes** are grouped together, they **form a cluster**.

A cluster is **controlled by a special node**, known as the **master node**. The master node watches over the other nodes and is responsible by the container orchestration on the worker nodes.

## Kubernetes Components

Kubernetes is composed by the following components:

### API Server

The API Server acts as the **frontend for Kubernetes**, it is used to interact with the Kubernetes cluster by users, management devices, CLIs, etc.

### `etcd` Keystore

`etcd` is a distributed reliable keystore used by Kubernetes to **store all data required to manage the cluster**.

> **How does a node know that other nodes exist?**
> `etcd` stores all the information on each node in a distributed manner.

### Scheduler

The scheduler is responsible for **distributing work**, (or containers), across multiple nodes.

It scans for newly created containers and assigns them to nodes.

### Controller

The controllers are responsible for **noticing and responding** when nodes, containers or endpoints **go down**.

Controllers make decisions to bring up new containers when this happens.

### Container Runtime

The Container Runtime is the **underlying software** that is used to **run the containers**.

### Kubelet

Kubelet is the agent that runs on each node in the cluster.

Kubelet is responsible for making sure that the containers are running in the nodes as expected.
