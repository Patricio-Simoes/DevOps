# 01. Overview

Kubernetes, (originally developed by Google), is an **open-source container orchestration platform** for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.

Kubernetes can be deployed on multiple platforms such as locally and on a cloud like AWS.

**Note:** For a list of Kubernetes commands, see [Kubernetes Cheatsheet](00.%20Cheatsheet.md).

## Container Orchestration

Container Orchestration s the automatic management of containerized applications, enabling efficient application deployment, scaling, and management in a complex environment.

It brings many advantages such as:

- Because there are multiple instances of an application running in different [nodes](#Nodes%20(Minions)), a hardware failure does not bring the application down. (**High availability** principle);
- The user traffic is **load balanced** across the various containers;
- The applications automatically scale up/down based on demand increase/decrease.

## Kubernetes Architecture

### Nodes (Minions)

A node, (previously known as minion), **is a machine**, (physical or virtual), on which Kubernetes is installed.

A node is a worker machine, where containers are launched by Kubernetes.

When **multiple nodes** are grouped together, they **form a cluster**.

A cluster is **controlled by a special node**, known as the **master node**. The master node watches over the other nodes and is responsible by the container orchestration on the worker nodes.

## Kubernetes Components

Kubernetes is composed by the following components:

### API Server

The API Server acts as the **frontend for Kubernetes**, it is used to interact with the Kubernetes cluster by users, management devices, CLIs, etc.

### `etcd` Keystore

`etcd` is a distributed reliable keystore used by Kubernetes to **store all data required to manage the cluster**.

> **How does a node know that other nodes exist?**
> `etcd` stores all the information on each node in a distributed manner.

### Scheduler

The scheduler is responsible for **distributing work**, (or containers), across multiple nodes.

It scans for newly created containers and assigns them to nodes.

### Controller

The controllers are responsible for **noticing and responding** when nodes, containers or endpoints **go down**.

Controllers make decisions to bring up new containers when this happens.

### Container Runtime

The Container Runtime is the **underlying software** that is used to **run the containers**.

### Kubelet

Kubelet is the agent that runs on each node in the cluster.

Kubelet is responsible for making sure that the containers are running in the nodes as expected.

## Kubernetes container runtimes

When Kubernetes originally came out, **it was built specifically around Docker and only Docker was supported**. However, with the growing popularity of the Kubernetes project, other tools like `Rocket` and `Containerd` also wanted to integrate with Kubernetes.

This was when the Container Runtime Interface (CRI) was introduced. **The CRI enables any container vendor to work as a container runtime for Kubernetes**, as long as they adhere to the Open Container Initiative, (OCI), Standard.

The CRI is a **plugin interface that defines the API for container runtimes to integrate with Kubernetes** which enables container runtimes to be developed independently of Kubernetes as long as they implement the CRI API.

Because Docker was widely used with Kubernetes and because Docker did not use the CRI, `Dockershim` was introduced, which was a was a **temporary solution that acted as a shim layer enabling Docker to communicate with Kubernetes without using the CRI** .

`Dockershim` was removed in version 1.24 of Kubernetes, **removing the support for Docker**. However, anything that previously worked with Docker will still work because it continues to work with `Containerd` which is an abstraction of Docker.

**Note:** All Docker images continue to work without any issues due to the fact that they adhere to the OCI Standard which allows them to be used with other container runtimes that also adhere to the OCI standard.
