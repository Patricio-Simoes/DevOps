# 01. Overview

Kubernetes, (originally developed by Google), is an **open-source container orchestration platform** for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.

Kubernetes can be deployed on multiple platforms such as locally and on a cloud like AWS.

## Key components

The key components of Kubernetes are:

- **Master Node (Control Plane)** : Node that manages the cluster;
- **Nodes** : A node is a worker machine controled by the cluster;
- **Pods** : A pod is the smallest deployable unit, (can contain one or more containers), that can exist on the cluster.

## Interacting with a cluster

To interact with a Kubernetes cluster, there are two ways:

- Using `kubectl` ("Cube Control") : Default command line toll used to interact with clusters; 
- Using `helm` : Package manager for Kubernetes.
